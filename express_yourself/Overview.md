What are we trying to make
==========================

40 + 2     ~~> 42
2*20 + 2   ~~> 42
x * 20 + x ~~> 42  [ x -> 2 ]

(if (x + 1) then x + 2 else 3) + 40 ~~> 43 [ x -> -1 ]
                                    ~~> 44 [ x -> 2 ]

x + y ~~> 42 [ x -> 2; y -> 40 ]

if (let x = 34 in x + x) then 69 else 420


Future
